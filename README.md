#Introduction:

Publicly listed companies in the U.S. are required by law to file "10-K" and "10-Q" reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These reports provide both qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the company's performance, from revenue numbers to qualitative risk factors.
